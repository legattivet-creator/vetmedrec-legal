About VetMedRec -
With so much information to remember, the health of those you love should not rely solely on memory.
VetMedRec was created by a veterinarian based on a common reality in clinical practice: pet owners often know their animals have undergone exams, treatments or important events, but rarely have this information organized or available during consultations.
The app solves this problem by centralizing the pet’s health history into a simple, organized and easy-to-share digital medical record. Exams, lab results, images, videos, documents and notes are all stored in one secure place — always accessible on the owner’s phone.
VetMedRec also includes a smart schedule that automatically generates reminders for recurring treatments, such as medications and deworming, with voice alerts available in multiple languages.
The app was designed to support real-life situations such as foster care families, animal rescue groups and independent caregivers, ensuring that medical history follows the pet wherever it goes.
For veterinarians, especially those providing home visits, VetMedRec offers tools to record consultations and generate professional documents.
The result is a digital veterinary health system that is accessible, shareable and focused on what truly matters: better care, continuity and safety for animals.
